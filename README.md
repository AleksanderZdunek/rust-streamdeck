# Rust Elgato StreamDeck Driver and Utility

An [hidapi](https://crates.io/crates/hidapi) based driver for direct interaction with Elgato StreamDeck devices, this is intended to allow applications to use these devices directly and on arbitrary platforms (without the use of the Elgato SDK), heavily based on the [python streamdeck library](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck).

## Getting started

- `cargo add streamdeck` to add this library to your project (with [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit))
- `cargo install streamdeck` to install the utility only
- `git clone git@github.com:ryankurte/rust-streamdeck.git` to clone the repo

Building requires `libusb` and `hidapi` packages.

### Setting up permissions on linux

- `cp 40-streamdeck.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/` to allow user access to streamdeck devices
  - note this may need to be edited with other vid/pid combinations for other devices
- `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` to reload udev rules

### Using the CLI

`streamdeck-cli --help` displays available subcommands and options, passing `--help` to subcommands (ie. `streamdeck set-image --help`) displays options for that subcommand

```
streamdeck-cli 0.4.1
A CLI for the Elgato StreamDeck

USAGE:
    streamdeck-cli [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --log-level <level>    Enable verbose logging [default: info]
        --pid <pid>            USB Device Product ID (PID) in hex [env: USB_PID=]  [default: 0063]
        --serial <serial>      USB Device Serial [env: USB_SERIAL=]
        --vid <vid>            USB Device Vendor ID (VID) in hex [env: USB_VID=]  [default: 0fd9]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    get-buttons       Fetch button states
    help              Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    reset             Reset the attached device
